            <h1>Are You Taking Alcohol-Free Days? Managing Daily Drinking and Health</h1>
            
            <p><strong>Has "just one drink today" become your nightly routine without realizing it?</strong></p>
            
            <p>When I was younger, I drank almost every day. After drinking out, I'd have vague memories the next morning, thinking "How did I get home?" At home, I'd pass out and wake up on the floor... That was my daily life.</p>
            
            <p>"You should take alcohol-free days for your health" — you hear this often, right? But many people struggle to maintain it because they don't know how many days they should take off or how to keep it up.</p>
            
            <p>I was the same. That's why I decided to create <strong>"a system that's easy to maintain."</strong></p>
            
            <h2>Why Are Alcohol-Free Days Important?</h2>
            
            <h3>Health Management and Sleep Quality</h3>
            
            <p>Even small amounts of alcohol, when consumed daily, burden your liver and reduce sleep quality. This results in morning fatigue, decreased concentration, and long-term risks of lifestyle diseases.</p>
            
            <p>However, "for your health" alone isn't enough motivation to keep it up in reality.</p>
            
            <h2>Simple Alcohol-Free Day Tracking for Easy Maintenance</h2>
            
            <p>That's why I created <strong>NomiReco</strong>, an app to simply track your drinking days.</p>
            
            <p style="margin: 2rem 0;">
                👉 <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/id1483451979" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Download Now for Free</strong></a>
            </p>
            
            <p>There are apps that track detailed alcohol amounts, but logging while drinking is tedious and hard to maintain. With NomiReco, you simply "record drinking days" before bed or the next morning.</p>
            
            <p><strong>To keep it up, simplicity is key.</strong></p>
            
            <h2>Key Features</h2>
            
            <div class="feature-box">
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>✅ One-tap recording</strong>: Simply record whether you drank that day</li>
                    <li><strong>📅 Calendar view</strong>: See alcohol-free days and drinking days at a glance</li>
                    <li><strong>📝 Notes feature</strong>: Record who you drank with and where</li>
                    <li><strong>📊 iPhone Health integration</strong>: Track weight changes simultaneously</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            
            <h2>More Than Just Tracking: Enjoy Looking Back at Memories</h2>
            
            <p>This isn't just a tracking app.</p>
            
            <p>"When was the last time I had drinks with ◯◯?"<br>
            "Who was I with and where did we go?"</p>
            
            <p>With the notes feature, you can look back at drinking occasions and special events on your calendar. As records accumulate, you gain <strong>"a sense of achievement" and "small wins"</strong> that fuel habit formation.</p>
            
            <h2>Track Weight and Health Together</h2>
            
            <h3>Visualize the Effects of Alcohol-Free Days Through Health Records</h3>
            
            <p>Furthermore, with iPhone Health integration, you can check weight trends on graphs.</p>
            
            <p>Many people who maintain alcohol-free days experience:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>Improved sleep quality</li>
                <li>Fresher morning awakening</li>
                <li>Gradual weight loss</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>With this app:<br>
            ✅ Alcohol-free day tracking<br>
            ✅ Drinking party memory management<br>
            ✅ Weight and health visualization</p>
            
            <p><strong>Everything in one app.</strong></p>
            
            <h2>5 Tips for Making Alcohol-Free Days a Habit</h2>
            
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Set a goal for how many days per week</strong><br>Start with one day per week. Once achieved, increase to 2, then 3 days. I aim for 4 days per week.</li>
                <li><strong>Check your records daily</strong><br>Visualizing your efforts on a calendar creates a sense of achievement that keeps you going.</li>
                <li><strong>Don't aim for perfection</strong><br>Enjoy drinking parties and special occasions without stress. Just resume alcohol-free days the following week.</li>
                <li><strong>Notice changes in your health</strong><br>Small changes like "I've been sleeping better lately" or "mornings are easier" become motivation to continue.</li>
                <li><strong>Use a tracking app as your ally</strong><br>Easy input and review tools dramatically lower the barrier to habit formation.</li>
            </ol>
            
            <h2>Changes I Experienced</h2>
            
            <p>After starting to use NomiReco, I became able to control my drinking by reducing intake the week after drinking too much. <strong>I can now maintain 4 alcohol-free days per week.</strong></p>
            
            <p>At first, there were days when I thought "I want to drink today..." But seeing on the calendar "I drank 5 days last week," I naturally thought "I'll skip today."</p>
            
            <p><strong>Recording makes your behavior objectively visible</strong> — that was the biggest change.</p>
            
            <h2>Take a Small Step Today</h2>
            
            <p>For those struggling with daily drinking habits and health management, simple tracking and review can be more powerful than you think.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Why not try it for just one week, starting today?</strong></p>
            
            <h3>Get Started in Just 3 Steps</h3>
            
            <div class="step-box">
                <p><strong>Step 1: Download the App</strong></p>

                </p>
                
                <p><strong>Step 2: Set One Alcohol-Free Day This Week</strong></p>
                <p>Mark it on the calendar and record it when the day ends</p>
                
                <p><strong>Step 3: Review After One Week</strong></p>
                <p>Look at your records and savor that small sense of achievement</p>
